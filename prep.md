###July2016PythonWorkshop

1.  Installation  
linux comes with python pre-installed test by running 'python' on the terminal for version check.  
Windows Users can use this [link](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) to get python.  
Moreover Users on Windows Xp quick walkthrough [here](http://dooling.com/index.php/2006/03/14/python-on-xp-7-minutes-to-hello-world/)  
IDEs and text editors best for python (Brackets Editor, Sublime)  

#### Schedule Flow:  

1. General Syntax:  
> This will involve setting up python files with the '.py' extension, code syntax formatting and running the first 'Hello Word' script on the terminal  
> Python's CLI should also be defined, explained and used for examples in both 2.7 and 3.x  
> Teaching schedule:

2. Variable Exercises:  
> This involves farmiliarizing with variables as memory locations in various operations such as arithmetics.  
> The students will also be introduced to Strings in Python and Datatypes which will also be compared to other programming languages thus exposing a number of python efficiencies  
> The students will also be introduced to python functions
